# go-bripguard
bripguard is a lightweight, plug-and-play Go library for browser-based request validation with IP consistency enforcement. It issues a multi-step JavaScript token challenge to the client and verifies the final token to ensure that requests come from a real browser and not from rotating IP bots or headless automation.
